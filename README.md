Showcase and game for the emerging art of "carpeetering."

Process:
Obtain data.xml from CarpetsForAirports

Obtain AirportCarpetsoftheWorld.kml from ACotW

Use parsing python scripts to standardize output.

Store output in data.json

Check image folders to see which airports have valid pictures

Check first CFA, then ACotW for description and location data.

Pull source images from each site with image_saver to keep a local backup in case source sites go down.
