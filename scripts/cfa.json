      "description":"Steven Freeling was one of the brightest and best carpet designers of the early 1980s. His designs broke new ground in their use of 18-foot repeats and Italian-style faux finishing. His innate artistic genius allowed carpet manufacturers to overlook his somewhat eccentric character. Never quite happy with his creations, Freeling labeled even such acknowledged masterworks of his as BGR, \u2018tired\u2019. In an attempt to push the boundaries of carpet design to the maximum he ended up gazing at the static on television screens for hours on end, jotting down the designs he thought he saw amidst the white noise. Soon he began to believe that the television was speaking to him, whispering of patterns undreamed of by man. On July 3rd, 1989, after an uninterrupted 76-hour session in front of the static, something snapped inside Steven Freeling's brain. He was found naked on his living room floor, his head thrust through the television screen. He had been electrocuted, but not before he had managed to program his dye-injection machines with the pattern for BHM. It remains the strangest of carpets, its pattern a seemingly ever-changing swirl of indistinct shapes perpetually slipping out of focus. Rumours that BHM was installed on top of an old Indian burial ground have been repeatedly denied.",

Hearing of the decree, and with the Red Guard marching to the airport to wreak devastation on the carpet, Tseng called on his past experience as a professor of textiles at Peking University and hurriedly wove the face of Mao into the carpet using a ball of silk he found in lost property. When the Red Guards arrived they were stopped in their tracks - they could not destroy an image of the Great Mao. Beijing Airport was thus left unmolested and Liu Tseng was declared a hero of the revolution. Five months later he was declared an enemy of the people and shot.

However in this picture we can see that a small family of wavy lines has been surrounded by a gang of rowdy triangle youths. Those who are of a squeamish nature had best look away.",

Located on Newfoundland, YYT was originally designed in the Second World War to intimidate and dissuade German spies from landing on the island. It succeeded beyond all measure - no Germans have visited Newfoundland in the past 70 years. A grey-blue tufted nylon carpet in a non-canonical gridiron pattern, it suggests unease and discomfort, chains and prisons. Even after all these years YTT can still put the fear of God into innocent travelers. Indeed even the husky carpeteer, Lauren Power, was so intimidated by its surly qualities that he could barely hold his camera steady when photographing it. Say what you want about the genial qualities of Canadians, but their carpets reveal the dark underbelly of all that cheery politesse.",

Mr. Tronier refused repeated requests for an interview saying he would not answer any questions unless they were asked in Proto-Norse, an ancient Scandinavian language.
