			copy_text="Steven Freeling was one of the brightest and best carpet designers of the early 1980s. His designs broke new ground in their use of 18-foot repeats and Italian-style faux finishing. His innate artistic genius allowed carpet manufacturers to overlook his somewhat eccentric character. Never quite happy with his creations, Freeling labeled even such acknowledged masterworks of his as BGR, ‘tired’. In an attempt to push the boundaries of carpet design to the maximum he ended up gazing at the static on television screens for hours on end, jotting down the designs he thought he saw amidst the white noise. Soon he began to believe that the television was speaking to him, whispering of patterns undreamed of by man. On July 3rd, 1989, after an uninterrupted 76-hour session in front of the static, something snapped inside Steven Freeling's brain. He was found naked on his living room floor, his head thrust through the television screen. He had been electrocuted, but not before he had managed to program his dye-injection machines with the pattern for BHM. It remains the strangest of carpets, its pattern a seemingly ever-changing swirl of indistinct shapes perpetually slipping out of focus. Rumours that BHM was installed on top of an old Indian burial ground have been repeatedly denied."

In actuality the punishment would continue until much of the skin and tendons of the victim had been 'burned’ off on the coarse horsehair and rope weave of the carpet.

The famed priest and interior decorator Father Joseph Jessup was asked to intervene. After thoroughly steam cleaning the carpet with holy water Jessup declared it to be possessed by Azazel, chief of the goat demons, who had escaped from the nearby state legislature disgusted at the ungodly practices taking place there. Father Jessup brokered a deal between Azazel and the airport authority, resulting in the blood sacrifice of one goat, or junior congressman, on the summer solstice each year. The event has since become something of a tourist attraction."

Hearing of the decree, and with the Red Guard marching to the airport to wreak devastation on the carpet, Tseng called on his past experience as a professor of textiles at Peking University and hurriedly wove the face of Mao into the carpet using a ball of silk he found in lost property. When the Red Guards arrived they were stopped in their tracks - they could not destroy an image of the Great Mao. Beijing Airport was thus left unmolested and Liu Tseng was declared a hero of the revolution. Five months later he was declared an enemy of the people and shot. His carpet was destroyed in the Gang of Five purges of 1976.

Surprisingly, and for reasons that probably hark back to his strict English upbringing, the Duke of Windsor accepted on condition that his visit be kept strictly secret. There is thus no record of whether the Duke approved of the new Girl Scout day camp, nor of his impressions of Oregonian life in general.

With the aid of a small battalion of itinerant carpet designers, the mustard and the chocolate sauce were then applied in a way that was thought to be visually appealing.'
